# Side-Project-1-
Hello everyone! So this is a side project that I did on my own time to work with a dataset of Brazilian high school student which includes 
daily/weekend alcohol consumption, time spent hanging out, grades for three marking periods, etc. The notes attached go into further 
explanation of what each number or binary answer represents. 

To use this script, download the .csv file and .py file into the same directory. On the compiler run the script by typing "python SideProject.py". What this will do is go through the entire code and output various descriptive statistics such as correlations and relative frequencies and various visuals of the data such as the histogram of student age distribution, the scatter matrix plot of the dataset for selected columns. The comments within the script will explain the process for why these certain outputs are occurring. 

This is all new to me so any feedback or advice would be much appreciated! Thank you!
